### Deployment Workflow with GitHub Actions

This project utilizes **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment. Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the deployment workflow is triggered, ensuring that the latest code is built and synced with the Amazon S3 bucket.

Below is a summary of the deployment workflow:

1. **Checkout the Code**: GitHub Actions checks out the latest version of the code.
2. **Setup Node.js**: Installs the necessary Node.js environment.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Runs `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
4. **Build Project**: Runs `npm run build` to build the project.
5. **Post-Build Optimization**: Executes post-build optimization scripts.
6. **Sync to S3**: Uses the AWS CLI to sync the built files to the S3 bucket, ensuring the latest version is deployed.
